### NEXT SESSION
- allow disabled video and using the images instead?
- bug when switching from season to vibe video no clue
- would be nice to share a link to a station but i think /winter/locked_in/0 is lame
    it would be cooler if the link was like a short slug like /aSllK3nkne that mapped to the station
    this seems more mysterious
